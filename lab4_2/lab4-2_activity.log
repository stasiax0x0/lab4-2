PHASE 2

scanme.nmap.org:22 is OPEN. --> this means there's an ssh service runni8ng and accepting connections

All these are closed, meaning the server is saying there's no service here. This is a good security practise.
scanme.nmap.org:9999 is CLOSED (refused)
scanme.nmap.org:53 is CLOSED (refused)
scanme.nmap.org:143 is CLOSED (refused)
scanme.nmap.org:993 is CLOSED (refused)
scanme.nmap.org:995 is CLOSED (refused)

PHASE 3

$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 30 --timeout 1.0
Scan complete in 4.76s — 2 open ports found
Wrote results to scan_results.json

Increasing the workers --> the scan completes faster, but too many workers can overwhelm the targets
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 50 --timeout 1.0
Scan complete in 2.93s — 2 open ports found
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 100 --timeout 1.0
Scan complete in 1.54s — 2 open ports found


Increasing the timeout --> nothing really changes
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 30 --timeout 3.0
Scan complete in 4.76s — 2 open ports found
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 50 --timeout 3.0
Scan complete in 2.90s — 2 open ports found
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 100 --timeout 3.0
Scan complete in 1.52s — 2 open ports found
$ python lab4-2_scan.py --host scanme.nmap.org --ports 20-1024 --workers 30 --timeout 10.0
